PowerShell script to create a new Active Directory User:

$newADUser = @{
	Name = "Marge Simpson"
	GivenName = "Marge"
	Surname = "Simpson"
	UserPrincipleName = "msimpson@someorg.com"
	SamAccountName = "marge.simpson"
	EmailAddress = "msimpson@somemeail.com"
	Description = "Hapless wife of Homer Simpson"
	OfficePhone = "123-234-7890"
	ChangePasswordAtLogon = $true
	AccountPassword = $(ConvertTo-SecureString "Password1" 	-AsPlainText -Force)
	Enabled = $true
}

Hit the green run button in PowerShell ISE or execute in PowerShell.

If you just call the variable $newADUser you will get an organized display of key:value pairs. 

In order to create a new AD User type in the following command in the PowerShell Terminal:

New-ADUser @newADUser

The '@' symbol is called the 'splat' symbol and allows the user to input multiple key:value pairs at the same time.
